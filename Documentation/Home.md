Summary
-------------
Projectary is a project created to allow in a simple way IPT student's to propose final course projects to their own advisory's teacher. This project allow student's from different courses and different schools to propose their final projects.

How students propose projects?
--------------------------------

If a student want do propose a project:
> - first thing he got to do is to create a group this new group must have at least two users: an advisory teacher and a student. An user can participate in various groups, such as a a group can have many users. 
> - after the group is created the group will make an application, an application is near future project depending on if it accepted as project or not. 
> - if application is accepted as project this means it is no longer possible project but instead a real one project.
> - the project will be associated to a course (and obviously this course is associated to a school where the course taught).
> - There will be years when the course is taught and other when it is not.

> **Note:**
Now that you have a idea how the project works you should take a look at the database model at [Modelo de Base de Dados][1], documented at github.
